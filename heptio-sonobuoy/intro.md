Heptio Sonobuoy is a diagnostic tool that makes it easier to understand the state of a Kubernetes cluster by running a set of Kubernetes conformance tests in an accessible and non-destructive manner. It is a customizable, extendable, and cluster-agnostic way to generate clear, informative reports about your cluster.

Its selective data dumps of Kubernetes resource objects and cluster nodes allow for the following use cases:

- Integrated end-to-end (e2e) conformance-testing
- Workload debugging
- Custom data collection via extensible plugins

For more information, the [Heptio Sonobuoy GitHub repository](https://github.com/heptio/sonobuoy) provides further information about the conformance tests, plugins, ...etc.
