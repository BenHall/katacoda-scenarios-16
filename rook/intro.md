Rook is a self-managing, self-scaling, and self-healing open source cloud-native storage orchestrator for Kubernetes, providing the platform, framework, and support for a diverse set of storage solutions to natively integrate with cloud-native environments.

Rook achieves this by automating deployment, bootstrapping, configuration, provisioning, scaling, upgrading, migration, disaster recovery, monitoring, and resource management.

In this scenario, we will learn how to deploy, administer, and consume file, block, and object storage on Kubernetes.
